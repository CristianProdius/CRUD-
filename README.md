# CRUD

<h1>Aim of Project</h1>
The project is a CRUD API built using GraphQL and the Python frameworks Starlette. It uses MongoDB as a database and is designed to be asynchronous. The data is validated using Pydantic and the code follows a clean architecture. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete data for a collection of objects that include fields such as name, surname, and dates of last login and registration. The read operation includes pagination and filtering by name, surname, and value. The project is meant to be deployed using Docker Compose and the code is written in Python 3.11 using Poetry for package management. The project also includes integration tests to ensure the functionality of the API.
